<h1>sample cv</h1>
<h2>Marco from nbcc</h2>
<br>Studying in NBCC, I prefer three classes: project management, physical education and practical English. Project management can let me learn a lot about this skill. Physical education can strengthen my body, and practical English can improve my English level My hobbies in college are programming and playing table tennis
My advantages are strong sense of responsibility and team consciousness. My disadvantages are poor physical resistance, rigidity and impulse<br>
<br>When something happens, don't rush to speak or make a decision. First, take a deep breath to regulate your mood and emotion. After the mood is stable, communicate and make decisions. Learn to empathize and think from the perspective of others. Your irritability may not only lose money, but also use more, such as family affection and friendship
like ATT, Coca Cola, Verizon, Nike, Visa, and other heavy hitters, are working to make sure they see those numbers grow year after year by investing in youth soccer facilities and promoting programs across the country. <br>
<br>So I intend to strive for every opportunity to show my talents. No matter what aspect, as long as it is where I am good at, I can better strive for opportunities to show my best and give full play to my advantages. We should take what we can do seriously, which can help us accumulate more experience and make ourselves do better and better in ordinary things, so as to give play to more advantages<br>
